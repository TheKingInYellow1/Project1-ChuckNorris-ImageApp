Chuck Norris Image App

Description:
This is the app we decided to make for our first bootcamp project. It is an app that allows you to search for an image and get a Chuck Norris joke with it.
We have used two different APIs for this Project. The https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random and the https://source.unsplash.com/800x600/.

Concept:
This app allows you to search images and get a complimentary Chuck Norris joke to go with it. 
The reason for making this app is, because searching for images on the internet is too boring and sometimes you need to spice it up with a unrelated Chuck Norris joke. 
AS A chuck norris and random image aficionado
I WANT to have an easy to use website to view those together
SO THAT i can create random and funny collaborations of the two

Technologies Used:
HTML, css, Javascript and APIs.
